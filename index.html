            <p>I graduated from CU Boulder in 2012 with a degree in Broadcast Production. Since then I have been working
                in bars
                and restaurants and traveling the world.
                I bought a one way ticket to Europe in 2014 and came home only twice over four years. Along the way I
                picked
                up any job I could to get by and save money. Staying in one place for longer than a couple weeks allows
                you to
                really understand
                the culture and local way of life. In the summer of 2016 I completed my Yoga Teacher Training in
                Rishikesh,
                India and taught yoga on the South coast of India for two years
                after. I am back in Colorado, with my Indian street dog that I rescued, ready to challenge myself and
                take a new
                direction in my life!</p>
